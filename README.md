# fs_extractor
 A tool to extract financial statement from https://www.eastmoney.com/ for myself. (which is actually useless)

To run this program, you need a stock code list txt, such as ["sz300750", "sh600030", "sh600519"]. Put this txt in the SAME PATH as fs_extractor.py and run it.

The extracted financial statements, which contain Balance Sheet, Income Statement and Cash Flow Statement are placed in "financial_statement\" as excels.

Interactions (such as set new values or change parameters) are not currently supported.
